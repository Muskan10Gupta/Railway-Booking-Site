To check a train status you need to go to NTES which gives you a lowdown on the location of a train by tracking its live location with the help of Global Positioning System (GPS) thereby sending you information about the train’s current station, departure from the last station and estimated arrival time at the next station. Follow the steps below to check the live status of trains.
<p style="color:salmon;text-align:left;font-family:arial;"> -Once you are on the website of NTES you will see a list of nine options in the top tab. To know the status of your train select the specific tab and type in the station name.
</p>
<p style="color:salmon;text-align:left;font-family:arial;">
-Click on the Trains between stations, type in the departure and destination train stations and the train type to receive information on the schedule of a train. To spot a train, select Spot your train and enter train name or number. To get faster and accurate results, it’s better to provide train name.
</p>
<p style="color:salmon;text-align:left;font-family:arial;">
-By clicking on Trains Cancelled you will receive a detailed information on fully cancelled trains and partially cancelled trains. Fully Cancelled trains are the trains not running from the source to destination station while the Partially Cancelled Trains run only on a part of the route. Simply type in the train number and the start date to get information on cancelled trains.
</p>
<p style="color:salmon;text-align:left;font-family:arial;">
-To check if your train has been rescheduled, select the rescheduled Trains which will give you information on the rescheduled trains. Fill in your train number to check whether it has been rescheduled or not. Likewise, you can get information on diverted trains as well.</p>
